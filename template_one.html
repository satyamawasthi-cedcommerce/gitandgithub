<p>This guide is beginner friendly, as the examples will be very easy to understand. It will also be a generalized tutorial so anyone can follow along no matter what your favorite programming language is.Demo content is probably one of the least talked about items in a designer’s toolbox. Yet, it’s also very useful. While we often see it as a means to populate a mockup or show what a CMS theme is capable of, there are other good uses.

For instance, it can serve as a placeholder during site development – you know, while you wait for the “real” stuff to arrive. This helps you continue to move forward on a project that could otherwise be stalled.

Likewise, demo content can live up to its name by helping you demonstrate various processes. Things like training videos or documentation can use bits and pieces to show users how a certain feature works. </p>

You can also install Git using the command line, but since the commands vary with each operating system, we'll focus on the more general approach.
How to configure Git

I will assume that at this point you have installed Git. To verify this, you can run this command on the command line: git --version.
